### Token Economics and Data Ownership Framework

### Token Types and Roles

Insight Genesis employs a dual-token model designed to facilitate secure data access, incentivize participation, and maintain a sustainable data economy:

### IGAI Token (Data Access Token):

The primary utility token of the platform, IGAI, is required for all data access transactions. It is used by data consumers (businesses, researchers) to purchase permissioned access to verified personal insights within DPI profiles. IGAI tokens represent full data access rights and are non-fractional. The total supply is fixed at 50 billion tokens.

### Wallet-bound Tokens (WBT - Data Ownership Tokens):

Each verified personal data point within a user’s DPI profile is represented by a Wallet-bound Token. Unlike traditional NFTs, these tokens are permanently bound to the owner’s wallet address and are **non-transferable**, ensuring that ownership and control remain with the original data contributor. WBTs confer governance rights over the associated data and enable granular control over data sharing and monetization.

### Wallet-bound Token (WBT) Characteristics

* **Non-transferability:** WBTs cannot be sold, gifted, or transferred to other wallets, preventing unauthorized data ownership changes.
* **Wallet Binding:** Each WBT is cryptographically linked to a specific wallet address, establishing a persistent and verifiable data ownership record.
* **Governance Rights:** WBT holders participate in governance decisions related to data sharing policies, platform upgrades, and verification standards.
* **Granular Control:** WBTs enable users to selectively grant, revoke, or time-limit access to individual data points within their DPI.

### Data Tokenization and Access Workflow

1. **Data Verification:**

Personal data submitted by users undergoes verification by decentralized oracles to ensure authenticity and quality.

### Wallet-bound Token Minting:

Upon successful verification, a Wallet-bound Token is minted and assigned to the user’s wallet, representing ownership of that verified data point within the DPI.

### Data Access Requests:

Data consumers submit requests specifying required data types and verification levels, paying IGAI tokens into escrow smart contracts.

### User Consent and Access Granting:

Users receive access requests and decide whether to grant permission for specific data points, managed via their WBTs.

### Payment Distribution:

Unlike traditional markets where reserve management is often centralized and opaque, our approach embraces decentralization and automation to maintain security without sacrificing efficiency.

The reserve pool serves multiple critical functions:

* **Fee Allocation:** 10% of all platform fees are allocated directly to the reserve pool, ensuring a steady capital base.
* **Platform Development:** Funds from the reserve support ongoing platform enhancements, including feature development, security audits, and scalability improvements.
* **Emergency Market Intervention:** The reserve provides liquidity and financial resources to stabilize the market during periods of extreme volatility or unexpected disruptions.
* **Security Incentivization:** A portion of the reserve is dedicated to incentivizing security measures, including bug bounties, penetration testing, and anomaly detection initiatives.

This strategic reserve management balances the necessity of maintaining market stability with the efficient utilization of capital to support growth and innovation.

### Market Protection Mechanisms

To safeguard the ecosystem against manipulation, abuse, and systemic risks, Insight Genesis implements a comprehensive, multi-layered market protection framework. Unlike traditional markets that often rely on reactive interventions, our protocol features proactive, autonomous mechanisms capable of detecting and responding to threats in real time.

Key components of the market protection system include:

* **Automatic Anomaly Response Protocols:** Continuous monitoring algorithms identify irregular trading patterns, suspicious behaviors, and potential manipulation attempts. Upon detection, the system triggers predefined countermeasures to mitigate risks swiftly.
* **Graduated Price Adjustment Limitations:** To prevent sudden and extreme price swings, the protocol enforces graduated limits on price changes within specified timeframes. This mechanism preserves orderly market function while allowing natural price discovery.
* **Emergency Termination Capabilities:** In cases of severe market stress or detected attacks, the system can temporarily halt trading or data access operations. This emergency brake protects users and the protocol from cascading failures or exploitative scenarios.

Together, these protection mechanisms form a resilient defense that preserves market integrity, fosters participant confidence, and supports sustainable ecosystem growth.

### Governance Framework

### DAO Governance Model

Insight Genesis introduces a pioneering tri-chamber governance structure that significantly advances decentralized protocol management. Unlike traditional single-chamber governance models prone to plutocratic dominance, this tri-chamber system balances the influence of diverse stakeholder groups, recognizing their unique contributions to the ecosystem’s health and growth. Voting power distribution is carefully calibrated to reflect the strategic importance and responsibilities of each group.

### Chamber Structure and Voting Power

The governance model divides voting power among three chambers, each representing key stakeholders:

### Data Owner Chamber (40%)

Composed of Wallet-bound Token holders, active data providers, and long-term contributors. This chamber prioritizes the interests of those who generate and maintain the core data assets.

### Platform Chamber (35%)

Includes $IGAI token holders, oracle providers (through staking), and service providers responsible for infrastructure and operational support.

### Technical Chamber (25%)

Consists of core developers, security experts, and technical contributors who maintain and evolve the protocol’s technology stack.

### Voting Power Calculation

Insight Genesis employs a sophisticated voting power formula tailored to each chamber’s characteristics, moving beyond simple token holdings to incorporate active participation, data quality, and technical contribution.

### Data Owner Chamber Voting Power:

Voting Power = (WBT Holdings × 1.0) +( Activity Multiplier × Data Quality Score)

* _Activity Multiplier:_ Ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 based on user engagement.
* _Data Quality Score:_ Ranges from 0.5 to 1.5, reflecting data freshness and accuracy.

### Platform Chamber Voting Power:

Voting Power = (IGAI Holdings × 1.0) + (Oracle Stake × 1.5)

* _IGAI Holdings:_ Direct token holdings.
* _Oracle Stake:_ Total tokens staked in oracle operations; multiplier reflects critical infrastructure role.

### Technical Chamber Voting Power:

Voting Power = (Base Contribution Score × Expertise Multiplier)

* _Base Contribution Score:_ Quantifies technical contributions.
* _Expertise Multiplier:_ Ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 based on specialization and track record.

### Oracle Stake Consideration

Oracles hold a unique dual role as service providers and governance participants. The framework grants them meaningful voting power proportional to their stake and contributions while implementing safeguards to prevent excessive concentration of influence.

### Oracle Voting Rights

Oracle governance participation is multifaceted, reflecting:

* Their $IGAI token holdings.
* Tokens staked in verification activities.
